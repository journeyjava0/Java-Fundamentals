 * MySQL Exercise 2:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Populate each table with at least 5 records.
 *
 *      6.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students
                SELECT * FROM college.students;
 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)
                SELECT * FROM college.teachers
                WHERE subject = "Math";
 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher
                SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name,
                	teachers.first_name, teachers.last_name
                FROM students
                JOIN teachers
                ON students.id = teachers.id;

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject
                SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name,
                	courses.name AS 'Course'
                FROM students
                JOIN students_courses
                ON students.id = students_courses.id
                JOIN courses
                ON students.id = courses.id
                WHERE courses.name = "design";
 *          e. update a record in the student table
                INSERT INTO `college`.`students` (`first_name`, `last_name`, `email`) VALUES ('bill', 'brown', 'bill@email.com');

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
 *              INSERT INTO `college`.`teachers` (`first_name`, `last_name`, `subject`) VALUES ('New', 'Guy', 'Social Studies');

 *       7.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
