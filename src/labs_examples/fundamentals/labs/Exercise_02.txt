1) If you haven't already, please create a Github account if you have not already done so.

2) Once complete, practice the following on your own machine and paste the commands you run for each step below.

Initializing git folder
    1. In CodingNomads folder, create new folder git_practice
    mkdir git_practice

    2. Inside git_practice:
        a. Initialize folder as a git folder (make sure you are in the correct folder when initializing) by running
            the "git init" command within the git_practice folder.
        λ cd git_practice
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/Desktop/Coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice
        λ  git init
        Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/Coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice/.git/
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/Desktop/Coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)

        b. Make new file
        λ vim practiceFile.txt

        c. Add file
       λ git add practiceFile.txt
       warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in practiceFile.txt.
       The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
       Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/Desktop/Coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice/git_practice (master)
       λ git config --global core.autocrlf true
       Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/Desktop/Coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice/git_practice (master)

        d. Commit file
     λ git commit -m "practice uploading to git"
     [master e3d7db1] practice uploading to git
      1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
      create mode 100644 practiceFile.txt


        e. On Github, create new git_practice repository

        f. Add this new GitHub repository as a new "remote" to your local Git repo. You can do this by using the command
        λ git remote add myGit1 https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice.git

        λ git remote -v
        myGit1  https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice.git (fetch)
        myGit1  https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice.git (push)

        g. Push commit file to Github
        λ git push myGit1 master
        Username for 'https://github.com': Journeyjava0@gmail.com
        Password for 'https://Journeyjava0@gmail.com@github.com':

        Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.

        To https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice.git
        286a32a..e3d7db1  master -> master

        h. Practice the following git flow until you feel comfortable:
            i.   Create or modify file
            ii.  Add file(s)
            iii. Commit file(s)
            iv.  Push file(s) to Github repository

Adding a remote
    1. Create new personal repository on Github named "git_practice_2".

    2. On local machine, add the new remote address to the same git repo you were working with in the previous section above
        (directions are provided on Github with new repo is created)
        λ git remote add myGit2 https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice_2.git
        λ git remote -v
        myGit1  https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice.git (fetch)
        myGit1  https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice.git (push)
        myGit2  https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice_2.git (fetch)
        myGit2  https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice_2.git (push)

    3. Push local git repository to your Github using the new remote.
λ git push myGit2 master
Username for 'https://github.com': Journeyjava0@gmail.com
Password for 'https://Journeyjava0@gmail.com@github.com':
To https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice_2.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice_2.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
