1) If you haven't already, please create a Github account if you have not already done so.

2) Once complete, practice the following on your own machine and paste the commands you run for each step below.

Initializing git folder
    1. In CodingNomads folder, create new folder git_practice
    Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads
    λ mkdir git_practice

    2. Inside git_practice:
        a. Initialize folder as a git folder (make sure you are in the correct folder when initializing) by running
            the "git init" command within the git_practice folder.
            Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads
            λ cd git_practice
            Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice
            λ git init
            Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/Coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice/.git/
            Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)

        b. Make new file
        λ vim gitPracticeFile.txt
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)

        c. Add file
        λ git add gitPracticeFile.txt
        warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in gitPracticeFile.txt.
        The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)
        λ git config --global core.autocrlf true
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)

        d. Commit file
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)
        λ git commit -m "uploading a text file for Exercise_02.txt"
        [master (root-commit) 074de20] uploading a text file for Exercise_02.txt
         1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
         create mode 100644 gitPracticeFile.txt
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)

        e. On Github, create new git_practice repository

        f. Add this new GitHub repository as a new "remote" to your local Git repo. You can do this by using the command
            git remote add <ANY_NAME> <URL_OF_NEW_GITHUB_REPO.git>
        λ git remote add git_practice https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice.git
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)

        g. Push commit file to Github
        λ git push git_practice
        fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
        To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

            git push --set-upstream git_practice master

        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)
        λ git push --set-upstream git_practice master

        Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'git_practice'.
        Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)


        h. Practice the following git flow until you feel comfortable:
            i.   Create or modify file
            ii.  Add file(s)
            iii. Commit file(s)
            iv.  Push file(s) to Github repository

Adding a remote
    1. Create new personal repository on Github named "git_practice_2".
    2. On local machine, add the new remote address to the same git repo you were working with in the previous section above
        (directions are provided on Github with new repo is created)
       λ git remote add origin https://github.com/journeyjava0/git_practice_2.git
         Owner@DESKTOP-KG96ESV ~/desktop/coding/Learning Java/CodingNomads/git_practice (master)
    3. Push local git repository to your Github using the new remote.
λ git push -u origin master

Cloning repository from Github
    1. Find a repository on Github
    2. Clone repository to local machine
    3. Create new repository on Github
    4. Add new remote on local machine
    5. Push to new Github repository
